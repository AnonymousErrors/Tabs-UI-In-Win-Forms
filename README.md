# Tabs-UI-In-Win-Forms
So I was bored and didn't have internet for some time and decide to make a simple tab control for a ide or something like this,  it's easy editable and doesn't require very much skill to understand, you can change the editor to monaco or somethin else too very easy
Ok if you don't like it just blame me but I really don't care.
I just made this so people can understand how a simple custom tabs system works
No I didn't skid this from anywhere it's 100% pure code by me
